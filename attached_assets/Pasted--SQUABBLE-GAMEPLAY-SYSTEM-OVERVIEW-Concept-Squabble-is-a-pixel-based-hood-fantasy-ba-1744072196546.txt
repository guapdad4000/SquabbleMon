# 🎮 SQUABBLE – GAMEPLAY SYSTEM OVERVIEW

## 🔥 Concept
Squabble is a pixel-based hood fantasy battler where players build a 3-character squad and explore a top-down world, encountering random fades and rival NPCs. It blends street culture, RPG progression, and collectible gear into a unique 3v3 battle system.

## 🧩 GAME FLOW STRUCTURE

1. **Start Screen**
   - “Start Game” / “Options”
   - Optional: Loadout, Settings, Save/Continue

2. **Character Select**
   - Choose 3 characters for your squad (out of 30+)
   - Squad becomes your main 3 throughout battles

3. **Overworld Exploration**
   - Top-down pixel world map (alleyways, parks, neighborhoods)
   - WASD or arrow key movement
   - Trigger battles by talking to NPCs or walking into zones (e.g., alley, trap house, etc.)

4. **Battle Trigger**
   - If in a random zone (like grass), or after dialogue with an NPC
   - Transition to battle screen using the current 3v3 battle system

5. **Battle System (Already Built)**
   - Each squad member takes turns
   - Use 1 of 4 moves per character
   - Win, earn XP and cash; lose, still get minor XP

6. **Post-Battle Return**
   - Player returns to same overworld spot
   - Optionally trigger side quest unlocks, rare NPC appearances, or store updates

## 📈 CHARACTER LEVELING SYSTEM

- **Max Level: 50**
- Characters unlock new moves as they level:

| Level Range | Move Unlocks            | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------------|-------|
| 1–5         | Start with 1–2 moves     | Entry tier |
| 6–15        | Move 2 unlocked          | Midway unlock |
| 16–30       | Move 3 unlocked          | Squad building begins |
| 31–50       | Move 4 unlocked          | Full move set |

- **After Level 50**:
  - No new moves
  - Progress is based on **money**, **gear**, and **luck events**
