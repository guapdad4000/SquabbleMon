# 🌍 SQUABBLE – OVERWORLD SYSTEM

The **Overworld** is the player’s main zone of exploration between battles. It’s a top-down, pixelated map styled like classic RPGs (think Pokémon, but set in an urban trap/fantasy hybrid). It’s where story, squad-building, and trap economy come together.

## 🧭 CORE FEATURES

### 🎮 Player Movement
- Top-down 2D
- Use **WASD or arrow keys**
- Smooth movement on a **tilemap grid** system
- Player sprite updates direction as you walk (up, down, left, right)

### 🧱 Tilemap System
- Built with **Tiled**, **Godot**, **Unity Tilemap**, or similar
- Contains:
  - Walkable areas
  - Blocked terrain (walls, fences, dumpsters, traffic cones)
  - Trigger tiles (grass, trap zones, etc.)
  - Door tiles (load into shops, homes, arenas)

## 🧑🏽‍🤝‍🧑🏽 NPC & ENCOUNTER LOGIC

### 🗣️ NPC Interactions
- Talkable NPCs with text boxes
- Some give quests, items, or lore
- Some will **challenge you to battle** with a fade animation
- NPCs can use unique character models (based on your existing sprite sheet system)

### ⚔️ Battle Triggers

#### Option A: **Direct NPC Challenge**
- Player walks up and presses a key (e.g., SPACE)
- NPC says “You lookin' for a fade?” and triggers battle

#### Option B: **Random Encounter Zones**
- Areas like **alleyways, graffiti-tagged walls, trap houses, or weed fields**
- Use a probability % to randomly start a battle after a few steps

```js
// Sample logic:
if (player.inTrapZone && steps % 5 === 0) {
  if (Math.random() < 0.25) {
    startBattle()
  }
}
🏙️ ZONE TYPES
Zone Type	Description
Starter Hood	Where player first spawns. Basic NPCs & items.
The Trap	Black market, side quests, dangerous encounters
The Block	Middle-tier enemies, shops, and quest givers
Rich Suburbia	Harder fights, rare gear, side convos
Back Alley Arena	Endgame/final boss area, elite NPCs
🛍️ ENTERING SHOPS & BUILDINGS
Step on a door tile or press interact

Loads new interior map scene (e.g., store, trap house)

Each shop can have a merchant NPC + item UI window

🎯 GOAL IN THE OVERWORLD
Explore for cash, fades, and lore

Talk to NPCs, accept quests

Hit the trap to upgrade your squad

Trigger fights organically, not through a menu

🔁 LOOP EXAMPLE
Player enters Trap Zone

Random encounter triggers → battle starts

After win: get XP, money, maybe an item drop

Return to map → walk to corner store

Buy Weed, Move Chip, or Dirt Bike

Walk into alley and find a shady NPC

Talk → get challenged → fade kicks off

Return to overworld — maybe now they sell you gear

💬 TEXT DIALOGUE (Basic Structure)
Use simple JSON-based dialogue arrays

js
Copy
Edit
{
  npcName: "OG Ras",
  lines: [
    "Ayo, youngblood.",
    "You rollin' through here like you own the trap?",
    "Lemme test them squabble hands."
  ],
  triggersBattle: true
}
🧠 DEV NOTES
Overworld is a scene that contains:

Player movement controller

Collision detection (solid tiles)

NPC collision & dialogue triggers

Random battle trigger system

Door trigger → scene change system

Keep all overworld systems modular

Zones, triggers, and shops should be reusable templates

Add weather, time of day, or music swaps later for immersion
